# Introduction

**mcellui** is a collection of beautifully designed, accessible UI components for Expo and React Native. Unlike traditional component libraries, mcellui uses a copy-paste approach - you own the code entirely.

## Why mcellui?

### You Own the Code

Components are copied directly into your project. No runtime dependencies, no version conflicts, no breaking changes from upstream updates. Customize everything to match your brand.

### Native First

Built specifically for React Native with platform conventions in mind. Uses `StyleSheet` for styling, `Reanimated` for animations, and respects iOS and Android design patterns.

### Accessible by Default

Every component is tested with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android). WCAG compliance where applicable.

### Dark Mode Built-in

System, light, and dark mode support out of the box with seamless transitions.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx mcellui init
```

This will set up your project with:
- Theme configuration
- Core utilities
- Your first component

Then add components as needed:

```bash
npx mcellui add button
npx mcellui add card
npx mcellui add input
```

## Philosophy

mcellui is heavily inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for web. We believe the same principles apply to mobile development:

1. **Copy-paste over npm install** - You should own your component code
2. **Composition over configuration** - Build complex UIs from simple primitives
3. **Accessible by default** - Accessibility shouldn't be an afterthought
4. **Beautiful out of the box** - But easy to customize

## Tech Stack

- **Expo SDK 54+** - The best way to build React Native apps
- **React Native 0.76+** - Latest stable features
