# Blocks

Blocks are pre-built screen templates that combine multiple components into complete, ready-to-use screens. Copy, paste, and customize to match your app's design.

## Available Blocks

### Authentication

- [Login Block](/docs/blocks/login-block) - Complete login screen with form validation
- [Signup Block](/docs/blocks/signup-block) - Registration screen with password confirmation

### Profile & Settings

- [Profile Block](/docs/blocks/profile-block) - User profile display with avatar and stats
- [Settings List Block](/docs/blocks/settings-list-block) - Settings screen with grouped options

### States

- [Empty State Block](/docs/blocks/empty-state-block) - Placeholder for empty content areas
- [Error State Block](/docs/blocks/error-state-block) - Error display with retry action

## Installation

Blocks are installed the same way as components:

```bash
npx mcellui add login-block
npx mcellui add profile-block
```

## Dependencies

Most blocks use the Form system and require these dependencies:

```bash
npm install react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers zod
```

The CLI will prompt you to install these automatically.

## Customization

Blocks are designed to be customized. After installation, you own the code:

1. **Change the layout** - Adjust spacing, alignment, order
2. **Modify colors** - Use your theme tokens
3. **Add/remove fields** - Customize form fields
4. **Change copy** - Update text and labels
5. **Add features** - Integrate with your backend
