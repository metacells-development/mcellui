## Tech Debt

### Pre-existing (not introduced by v1.1)

- **MCP server:** 2 strict null check errors in parseComponentDocs (tools/index.ts)
- **CLI:** 15 strict null check errors across pick.ts and update.ts (runtime safe — early exits prevent null access)

### Phase 15 borderline

- 4 `console.log(chalk.red)` instances in CLI commands are status output, not errors. Verifier flagged as borderline but accepted.

### Recommendations for v1.2

1. Fix strict null check errors in CLI and MCP server
2. Integrate `npm run validate:registry` into CI
3. Add integration tests for CLI flows
4. Generate API docs from Phase 18 JSDoc
